Why shox is a physically perfect human being

Richard "shox" Papillon, rifler for Team Vitality, was born on May 27, 1992. The Frenchman started his journey as a Counter-Strike player at just nine years old. At that age, humans go into a new stage of development: preadolescence. Children begin to develop a sense of self-identity, and to have increased feelings of independence.(1)  Still, they are not yet ready to support themselves, and are typically part of a family that supports them. How the family raises the child, shapes their future and is crucial for their mental and physical development in later stages of their life. Later on, shox was lucky to have a supportive family, who supported him when he wanted to take a year off his studies, in order to play full time.

Whether shox has his upbringing to thank for his determination to succeed, or whether it is innate - it goes without question that shox tackles challenges with resolve. When the Counter-Strike community went back to 1.6, he and his French friends stuck with Counter-Strike: Source, and he kept grinding. The mentality to always go for more, and fight every battle in the game, is the same mentality that keeps shox in great physical shape. And it goes both ways. Mens sana in corpore sano: physical exercise is important for your mental well-being. It helps the player to stay focused and level-headed in exciting matches. Thus, shox is not just a god in the game of Counter-Strike, but a physically perfect human being.
